## Conditions Tasks:

```python

#1
10 > 15
False

#2
if 10 > 15:
    print ("Full Stack")
elif 10 < 15 :
    print ("x smaller than 15")

    
x Smaller than 15

#3
'''

'''
#4
'''

but when we will more than two  can we use all that is easler
'''
#5
'''
- we use or when we have one or two option but when
we have more option we cann use  any that is easler
'''
#6
'''

'''
#7
'''
we can use one if with condition but we can use  more than elif with him '''
#8
'''
elif that for more condition but else we can use just one for alternative code
with condition
'''
#9
'''yes of course'''
#10
'''

'''
#11
'''
true condition false
ex:
'''
z = 500
z
500
print ("is true") if z == 588 else print ("is false")
is false
#12
'''
that not true
when we have true python make the condition and the  rest from code ,
but when we have false python ignore this condition and make the rest from others
cods .
